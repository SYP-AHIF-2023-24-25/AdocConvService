This is the reference guide for Solardoc, its technology stack and how to use it. This guide is intended for developers
and will serve as a reference similar to `DEVELOPMENT.md` but with more in-depth explanations and examples.

Additionally, this should serve as a guide how to extend or replace certain elements from a newcomer perspective.
